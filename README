This is an android based calculator that calculates the billing amount from the total amount of the electricity bill.
This simply divides the bill into fixed and variable costs and separates the costs accordingly into the users.
The first iterations of this application are focussed on providing different features to its users, but in later versions, I would try to convert this application from a highly customized one to a generic one that can be used by everyone that require a subdivision of their bills.
